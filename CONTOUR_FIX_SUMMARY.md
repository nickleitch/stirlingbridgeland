# Contour Generation Coordinate Limit Fix

## Problem Identified
- **Error**: "Failed to generate contours: Contour generation failed: Failed to get elevation grid: Too many coordinates. Maximum 100 per request"
- **Root Cause**: Default `grid_points` parameter was set to 12, creating 12×12 = 144 coordinate points
- **API Limit**: Open Topo Data service has a maximum of 100 coordinates per request

## Solution Implemented
Reduced `grid_points` from 12 to 9 across all relevant files:

### Files Modified:
1. **Backend Service**: `backend/services/contour_service.py`
   - Changed `self.default_grid_points = 12` to `self.default_grid_points = 9`

2. **Backend Server**: `backend/server.py` 
   - Changed default parameter from `grid_points = 12` to `grid_points = 9`

3. **Frontend Controls**: `frontend/src/components/layers/ContourGenerationControls.js`
   - Changed `grid_points: 12` to `grid_points: 9` in settings state

4. **Frontend API Service**: `frontend/src/services/contourAPI.js`
   - Changed `grid_points = 12` to `grid_points = 9` in default parameters

### Additional Fixes:
- **Environment Configuration**: Fixed `CORS_ORIGINS` in `.env` file to proper JSON array format
- **Database Configuration**: Updated `DATABASE_NAME` environment variable mapping in settings
- **Type Safety**: Added null parameter validation in server endpoints

## Technical Details
- **New Grid Size**: 9×9 = 81 coordinate points (safely under 100 limit)
- **Validation Range**: Server validation allows grid_points between 3-20, so 9 is valid
- **Boundary Filtering**: Maintains existing property boundary filtering functionality
- **API Compatibility**: Preserves same parameter structure between frontend and backend

## Testing Status
- ✅ **Code Changes**: All grid_points references updated from 12 to 9
- ✅ **Frontend Restart**: Successfully recompiled with new parameters
- ✅ **Backend Dependencies**: Fixed missing `ezdxf` module dependency
- ⚠️ **Full Testing Blocked**: MongoDB connection required for complete end-to-end testing
- ✅ **PR Updated**: Changes committed and pushed to existing PR

## Expected Result
When MongoDB is available and backend server runs successfully:
- Contour generation should complete without "too many coordinates" error
- 9×9 grid (81 points) stays safely under Open Topo Data's 100-coordinate limit
- Contours should display properly on the map within property boundaries

## Environment Requirements
- MongoDB service running on localhost:27017 for backend database connection
- Backend server startup depends on successful database connection
- Frontend successfully loads with updated grid_points parameters
