          comment: "Progress circles on project cards display correctly with teal stroke-based design. The circles use stroke outlines rather than filled shapes, with teal (#4a9b9e) for filled segments and light gray (#d4d4d8) for empty segments. The design is clean and minimal with circular segments as specified in the requirements. The styling has been successfully restored to the original teal design style."

          comment: "Contour generation API works correctly and successfully adds contour boundaries to the project data (800 contour boundaries were added during testing). However, the contours are not being displayed on the map. The issue appears to be in the filtering logic in useBoundaryData.js. The getBoundariesForLayer function is only returning boundaries that contain the search point, but contours typically don't contain the search point. The 'isBaseDataLayer' check should be working for 'generated_contours' but the contours are still being filtered out. The console logs show that the layer is correctly configured and the toggle is enabled, but no contours appear on the map."

      message: "Contour Generation and Display testing completed. Found critical issue: Contours are being generated successfully (800 contour boundaries added to project data) but they are not being displayed on the map. The issue is in the boundary filtering logic in useBoundaryData.js. Despite 'generated_contours' being in the isBaseDataLayer list, the contours are still being filtered out. The getBoundariesForLayer function is only returning boundaries that contain the search point, but contour boundaries typically don't contain the search point. The layer toggle is enabled and the data exists in the project, but no contours are rendered on the map."
