          comment: "Progress circles on project cards display correctly with teal stroke-based design. The circles use stroke outlines rather than filled shapes, with teal (#4a9b9e) for filled segments and light gray (#d4d4d8) for empty segments. The design is clean and minimal with circular segments as specified in the requirements. The styling has been successfully restored to the original teal design style."
