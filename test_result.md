      message: "Progress Circle Styling testing complete. Successfully verified that the progress circles on project cards display correctly with the restored teal stroke-based design. The circles use stroke outlines rather than filled shapes, with teal (#4a9b9e) for filled segments and light gray (#d4d4d8) for empty segments. The design is clean and minimal with circular segments as specified in the requirements. The styling has been successfully restored to the original teal design style. All test points have been verified and passed."
