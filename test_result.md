        comment: "Successfully tested the updated contour generation system. Verified that the default contour interval is now 10.0m (previously 2.0m), the default grid size is 2.0km, and the default grid points is 12 (though we used 5 in tests to avoid API limits). The property boundary filtering functionality is working correctly, filtering contours to only include those within Farm Portions or Erven boundaries. The API properly handles the property_boundaries parameter and returns appropriate responses. Error handling for invalid parameters (negative contour interval, invalid coordinates) is also working correctly. The contour styles endpoint correctly returns the updated default interval of 10.0m."

    message: "Completed testing of the updated contour generation system. All tests are passing. The system now correctly uses 10.0m as the default contour interval (instead of 2.0m), properly filters contours to only include those within Farm Portions or Erven boundaries, and has simplified parameters to reduce failure risk. The API endpoints are working as expected and handle errors appropriately."
